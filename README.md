# Classification Models Showcase  
This project demonstrates how to implement and evaluate classification models in Python using popular machine learning libraries.  

## Features  
- **Data Preparation**: Loading synthetic or CSV data and splitting it into features and targets.  
- **Train-Test Split**: Allocating 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing.  
- **Modeling**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy and classification reports.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or later  
- Libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
